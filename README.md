This project is only usable by owners of the game "1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum" on Steam. 

See contents of the folders for files in the patches and how to manually apply them.

The Bonding_Achievement_Patch directory has a patch which fixes a naming issue that prevents most of the achievements named 
"Bonded With" from dropping when the game is complete and you have the required relationship points.

The 50_Percent_Less_Grinding directory has a change which reduces the amount of grinding you need to do to get past obstaces in the game.
