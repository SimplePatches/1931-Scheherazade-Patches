This patch is only suitable for owners of the game "1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum" on Steam. 

It fixes a naming issue that all the "Bonded with" achievements have that prevent them from triggering even though you have 
maxed out the points. If you have a savegame near the end where you have done this, the achievement should be awarded when you 
reach the ending.

The patch has to be applied manually.

Close "1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum" if you are running it.

Right click on "1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum" and select Properties.

Click on the tab "Local Files".

Select "Browse Local Files".

In the file explorer that launches open the folder called game.

Copy the file end_interview.rpy from this patch into this directory. If you have not done this previously, it will not overwrite any files.

Run "1931: Scheherazade at the Library of Pergamum" and restore save game and contimue or start a new game.
